Hey there! I'm Nick (aka DJ Neos), and my passion for music was ignited as a regular club-goer in Melbourne's electrifying late 90s and early 2000s club scene. Immersed in the pulsating rhythms of dance music and the raw beats of hip-hop, those early experiences captivated me and stuck with me decades later to shape my current approach to DJing.

Later in life, I started experimenting with a DJ controller as a hobby. Spinning tunes at home and at friends' parties ignited a passion. I soon realised that nothing comes close to beating the adrenaline rush you get from DJing a party, dropping the perfect tracks, and seeing the dancefloor explode!

Over the years, I've honed my skills blending a diverse range of genres: pop, rock, house, edm, disco, r&b, hip hop, and more...across all decades from old-school classics to current hits. When I'm spinning those throwbacks especially, I'm transported back to what was big on the dancefloor in my clubbing days, and I love sharing that energy and nostalgia with the crowd.

Based in Melbourne, I'm available for hire for your next event! So whether it's a wedding, corporate event, birthday, or any special occasion, I work closely with my clients to understand their unique vision and curate a set that perfectly complements the event and gets the party rocking!
