I specialise in creating a fun and energetic atmosphere for every wedding, from intimate gatherings to larger celebrations. I'm skilled at reading the crowd and seamlessly [blending genres](/mixes/) to keep your dance floor packed all night long.

**My fee typically falls within the $700 - $1200 range.** Exact pricing depends on your specific date, venue, location, and guest count. Get in touch for a personalised quote [here](/contact/).
