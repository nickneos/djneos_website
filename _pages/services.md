I specialise in creating a fun and energetic atmosphere for every wedding, from intimate gatherings to larger celebrations. I'm skilled at reading the crowd and seamlessly [blending genres](/mixes/) to keep your dance floor packed all night long.

My quotes typically fall within the $700 - $1100 range. Exact pricing depends on your specific date, venue, location, and guest count. Get in touch for a personalised quote [here](/contact/).{: .notice--info}

### What's included

- Coverage of a reception for up to 5 hours (eg. 6pm to 11pm). Additional hours can be negotiated and added to your package.
- Arrival 1-2 hours prior to the reception for setup, sound checks, and preparation.
- A professional sound system perfectly sized for your guest count and venue.
- Live DJ mixing throughout the reception.
- Dynamic party lighting to enhance the atmosphere and set the mood.
- Wireless microphone for announcements and speeches.
- As many consultations as needed leading up to your wedding (in person or via zoom) to ensure the music and vibe perfectly reflects your vision for the day.

### The Booking Process

1. Think I'm your guy? Request a quote [here](/contact/).
2. Let's chat and ensure we're the right fit for each other. Feel free to ask as many questions as you want!
3. Lock me in and secure your date by signing a service agreement and paying a $200 deposit.
4. I will send a fun little music questionnaire for you to complete. I usually send this out a few months before the wedding, when you have a clearer idea of the night's format from your venue, wedding planner, or other vendors.
5. We'll then catch up (in person or via Zoom) to go through the music questionnaire, discuss your musical tastes, preferred vibe, and the run sheet for the night, allowing us to finalise all the finer details.
6. I will do a quick check-in with you the week leading up to your wedding to confirm any last-minute changes to the run sheet or other arrangements.
7. The remaining balance will be due 3 days before your wedding.
8. It's the big day! Time to party!
